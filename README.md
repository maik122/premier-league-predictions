# Premier league prediction system

A machine learning project that predicts the winner of Premier League football matches using historical match data. Multiple algorithms were trained and compared, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Networks.

---

##  Features

- Predicts match outcomes (Win/Loss/Draw)
- Supports multiple ML models: SVM, Random Forest, and DNN
- Compares model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
- Visualises key metrics and predictions
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering included

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

---

##  Models Used

| Model              | Description                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| SVM               | Classification using match stats    |
| Random Forest     | Tree-based model for performance    |
| Deep Neural Net   | Custom multi-layer network          |

Each model was trained and tested on the same dataset for comparison.

##  Dataset

- Historical Premier League match data
- Features: home/away team, goals, match result, form, etc.
- Preprocessed to remove nulls, encode categories, and balance classes
